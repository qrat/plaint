#'
#' This packages provides two S3-type functions: \code{\link{form}} formats,
#' accentuates and filters data arrays and \code{\link{latex}} exports 'formed'
#' data frames to LaTeX code resulting in state of the art tables. Both
#' functions allow the user to easily transform arbitrary dataset based on a
#' user-specified set of rules and table markup. Read this documentation, the
#' vignettes and study the examples in order to see how you can employ these
#' functions with joy.
